Usage
-----

Once you visit HarvardShuttle.org, you will be prompted to share your location information.  If you provide your location data, HarvardShuttle will automatically determine the closest shuttle stop near you.  Once a shuttle stop is determined, HarvardShuttle will automatically provide the next shuttle arrival times and route information.  You can change or refine arrival time infomation by either changing the origin stop or adding an optional destination stop.  If both an origin and destination stop is selected, alternative walking route and time information is provided.  The web application refreshes shuttle information every 20 seconds.

FAQ
---

What makes HarvardShuttle different from Shuttleboy?

HarvardShuttle uses real-time GPS data to calculate and provide arrival time information.  Real-time information is more accurate and relevant than a scheduled time-table.  HarvardShuttle's interface is also designed to be navigated faster and more intuitively.
