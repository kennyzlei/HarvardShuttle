HarvardShuttle Design
---------------------

Shh...this is the secret recipe behind HarvardShuttle.  This is completely classified information.  No prying eyes.  Those with security clearance, continue on...

Web Technologies
----------------

HarvardShuttle.org is purely based on HTML5 + JS.  All scripts and rendering are completed on client-side for speed and efficiency.  JQuery was used frequently for writing JS.  Most custom JS resides in harvardshuttle.js file.

Frameworks
----------

Like almost every modern website on the internet, HarvardShuttle.org uses the Bootstrap by Twitter framework.  A modified version of bootstrap-select was used to stylize HTML select elements like dropdown menus.  Overall, very little customization was done on the framework.

APIs
----

HarvardShuttle employs the Transloc Open API and Bing Maps API.  Transloc provides the latest GPS data and shuttle information.  Bing Maps was used to visualize geolocation as well as provide walking time estimates.

Design Flow
-----------

1. Cache Stop and Route Information
2. Request Arrival Estimates When Shuttle Stops Selected
3. Provide Walking Estimates, if necessary

Future Design
-------------

Windows 8 Application designed using HTML5 + JS interface, employing WinJS to access native device features.

Windows Phone, Android, and iOS designed using PhoneGap using HTML5 + JS.
